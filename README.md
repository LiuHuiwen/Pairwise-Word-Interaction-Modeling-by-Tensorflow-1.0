# Pairwise-Word-Interaction-Modeling-by-Tensorflow-1.0
The model is based on paper[1]. I read this paper and decide to made it by myself. This paper has in this project.

I choose Tensorflow r1.0 to write my code. website:https://www.tensorflow.org/

prtrain word2vec I used https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec and my train set is common text8, but I remove stop-words.
